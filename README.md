3. Problem Scenario
Managing employee performance manually can lead to several challenges:
Inefficiency: Paper-based or spreadsheet-based performance reviews can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Lack of Transparency: Employees may not have a clear view of their goals, feedback, or progress, leading to disengagement.
